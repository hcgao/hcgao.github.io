<h1>AAAI 2024 Tutorial: Distributed Stochastic Nested Optimization for Emerging Machine Learning Models</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>In recent years,  some new learning paradigms have been proposed to address various challenges in practical applications. 
Of particular interest in this tutorial is the learning paradigm that can be formulated as a stochastic nested optimization (<b>SNO</b>) problem 
because it covers a wide range of emerging machine learning models, such as model-agnostic meta-learning, imbalanced data classification models, contrastive self-supervised learning models, neural architecture search, etc. 
More specifically, this tutorial will focus on two instances of SNO: stochastic compositional optimization (<b>SCO</b>)  and stochastic bilevel optimization (<b>SBO</b>).  
The nested structure in these two classes of optimization problems brings unique challenges for their distributed optimization. 
A series of new techniques have been developed to address them in the past few years. However, these recent advances have not been disseminated to broad audiences. 
Thus, this tutorial aims to introduce the unique challenges,  recent advances, and practical applications of distributed SCO and distributed SBO, with a special focus on federated learning and decentralized learning settings.  
The audience will benefit from this tutorial by mastering the understanding of distributed SCO/SBO algorithms and applying them to real-world applications. </p>
